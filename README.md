# A VERY old project I never finished. 
# Seems like a perfect toy to restart my github and keep my skills up to scratch while I'm looking for a new position and after I found it

# As it will be reaching a production stage, people are free to use it as they please as long as they credit my work

# Different parts of the project will get separated into the modules in their own right as and when I see fit

# The project will require knowledge of at least Views and Stored Procedures in MySQL. You will be required to work directly with your database

# The development is done on priniciple of "Using Database as an API/Service"

# No. I don't care if you have a panic attack at words "Stored Procedure"

# No. I will NOT make it any other way

# No. I Don't have to be nice to you... I will offer a very picturesque route to all who ask to develop in a different way

# I might add a few things later
